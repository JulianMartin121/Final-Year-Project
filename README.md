My Final Year Project for University of Surrey. At the current moment, I am developing a skeleton  web-page that is meant to replicate Surreylearn. 

The project is focused on "Exploring the use of a real time chat interface in Surreylearn"

In response to the reliance of third-party communication applications such as Outlook and Microsoft Teams at the University of Surrey, this project proposes the integration of a real-time chat interface within SurreyLearn. There is support of a basic messaging and emailing system which is overlooked by many who use SurreyLearn and thus my project will explore how the implementation of the chat interface could be integrated into SurreyLearn, it is expected to enhance the educational experience at SurreyLearn by improving accessibility, responsiveness and engagement in the online learning environment.
